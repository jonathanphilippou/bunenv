# TICKET-010: Distribution and Packaging

## Description

Prepare the bunenv project for distribution and packaging. This includes setting up the npm package, creating release scripts, and implementing continuous integration for automated testing and releases.

## Tasks

- [x] Set up package.json
  - [x] Add correct metadata (name, version, description, etc.)
  - [x] Set up dependencies and dev dependencies
  - [x] Configure npm scripts for building, testing, and releasing
  - [x] Add bin entries for CLI commands
- [x] Create build pipeline
  - [x] Set up TypeScript compilation
  - [x] Configure bundling (if needed)
  - [x] Add source maps for debugging
  - [x] Implement minification for production
- [x] Set up CI/CD
  - [x] Configure GitHub Actions for testing
  - [x] Set up automated releases
  - [x] Implement versioning strategy
- [x] Create release workflow
  - [x] Add changelog generation
  - [x] Set up semantic versioning
  - [x] Create release script
- [x] Add installation methods
  - [x] npm installation instructions
  - [x] Manual installation instructions
  - [x] Shell script installer

## Status

- Package.json updated with proper metadata and script configuration ✅
- Build pipeline implemented for both development and production ✅
- CI/CD workflows created for testing and releasing ✅
- Semantic versioning and changelog implemented ✅
- Installation methods documented with easy installer script ✅

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Project can be installed via npm globally
- [x] CI pipeline runs tests automatically on pull requests
- [x] Releases are automated and versioned correctly
- [x] Package size is optimized for distribution
- [x] Installation works correctly on all supported platforms
- [x] Version information is accessible via CLI

## Notes

- The installer script automatically handles shell integration setup
- CI/CD workflow detects the correct Node.js and OS combinations
- Build system includes type checking to ensure code quality
- Release process is tied to GitHub releases for easier tracking
- Package.json now uses specific dependency versions for better stability

## Distribution Strategy

### npm Package

- Global installation recommended
- Properly structured for Node.js/Bun compatibility
- Include only necessary files

### GitHub Releases

- Tagged releases with changelogs
- Prebuilt binaries for easy installation
- Release notes with upgrade instructions

### CI Integration

- Run tests on multiple platforms
- Ensure compatibility with different Node.js/Bun versions
- Automate release process

## Implementation Details

1. **Build Process**

   - TypeScript compilation with type checking
   - Bundle optimization for production
   - Source maps for development
   - File permission preservation

2. **Distribution**

   - npm packaging with appropriate files included
   - Shell script installer for easier adoption
   - Automated CI/CD via GitHub Actions

3. **Version Management**
   - Semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
   - Changelog generation for release notes
   - Automated publishing tied to GitHub releases
