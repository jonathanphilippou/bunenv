# TICKET-007: Refactor CLI commands

## Description

Refactor the CLI commands to use the new core modules, version resolver, shim generator, and version manager. Ensure consistent command behavior and improved error handling.

## Tasks

- [ ] Refactor the `init` command to use the new modules
- [ ] Refactor the `install` command to use the version manager
- [ ] Refactor the `list` command to use the version manager
- [ ] Refactor the `use` command to use the version manager and version resolver
- [ ] Refactor the `local` and `global` commands for version management
- [ ] Refactor the `rehash` command to use the new shim generator
- [ ] Refactor the `shell` command for temporary version switching
- [ ] Create integration tests for each command
- [ ] Update the help text and error messages for all commands

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All commands use the new module structure
- [ ] Command output is consistent and informative
- [ ] Error handling is improved with helpful messages
- [ ] Commands follow a consistent pattern for arguments and options
- [ ] Integration tests verify complete command behavior
- [ ] Help documentation is updated to reflect any changes
- [ ] Shell integration works reliably on different shells

## Notes

- Consider adding color to the CLI output for better readability
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing command syntax
- Focus on consistent user experience across commands
- Improve the verbosity level options to provide more or less information as needed
- Use environment detection to adapt command behavior when appropriate
