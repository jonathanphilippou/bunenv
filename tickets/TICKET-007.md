# TICKET-007: Refactor CLI commands

## Description

Refactor the CLI commands to use the new core modules, version resolver, shim generator, and version manager. Ensure consistent command behavior and improved error handling.

## Tasks

- [x] Refactor the `init` command to use the new modules
- [x] Refactor the `install` command to use the version manager
- [x] Refactor the `list` command to use the version manager
- [x] Refactor the `version` command to use the version resolver
- [x] Refactor the `local` and `global` commands for version management
- [x] Refactor the `rehash` command to use the new shim generator
- [x] Refactor the `shell` command for temporary version switching
- [x] Create basic integration tests for CLI commands
- [x] Update the help text and error messages for all commands

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] All commands use the new module structure
- [x] Command output is consistent and informative
- [x] Error handling is improved with helpful messages
- [x] Commands follow a consistent pattern for arguments and options
- [x] Integration tests are created (marked as skipped for now, to be fully implemented in a future ticket)
- [x] Help documentation is updated to reflect changes
- [x] Shell integration works reliably on different shells

## Notes

- [x] Added color to the CLI output for better readability via consistent output utility functions
- [x] Maintained backward compatibility for existing command syntax
- [x] Focused on consistent user experience across commands
- [x] Improved error handling with specific error messages and help text
- [x] Used environment detection to adapt command behavior when appropriate

## Future Improvements

- Enhance integration tests to fully validate command behavior
- Add more comprehensive component tests for CLI commands
- Consider adding verbosity level options for more detailed output
