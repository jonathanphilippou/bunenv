- Basic tests are passing
- Testing utilities for mocking filesystem and CLI have been implemented
- Direct function tests for core functionality are passing
- CLI command tests are properly skipped with clear documentation
- Test suite is clean and organized
- Documentation is comprehensive, including:
  - Detailed README.md
  - Shell integration guide for bash, zsh, and fish
  - Usage examples for different version management scenarios
  - Project architecture and contribution guidelines
- Distribution system is set up:
  - npm package configured for global installation
  - Build system optimized for production
  - CI/CD workflows for automated testing and releases
  - Installer script for easy setup

## Next Steps

1. Complete comprehensive tests

   - Refine CLI test harness to properly handle Commander commands
   - Enable skipped CLI command tests
